![ProtoStax Weather Station Demo](ProtoStax_Weather_Station_Demo.jpg)

using [ProtoStax for Raspberry Pi B+](https://www.protostax.com/products/protostax-for-raspberry-pi-b)

## Prerequisites

* Enable SPI on the Raspberry Pi
* API Key from Open Weather Map  - [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* City ID from Open Weather Map for the city of your choice - see
main.py comments for more details
* Python 3 or higher. The code and the ePaper library assumes you are
  using Python 3 or higher! (with Raspbian Buster, the latest is
  Python3.7)

**Install spidev, RPi.gpio and Pillow**

```
sudo apt-get install python3-spidev
sudo apt-get install rpi.gpio
sudo apt-get install python3-pil
```

## Installing

This demo uses the PyOWM library - see
[https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm](https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm)

It also uses Waveshare's ePaper libary - see
[https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper](https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper)

but includes the necessary files from that library directly, so you
**don't need to install anything extra**!

**NOTE - Use pip3!**

*Note: The latest version of PyOWM (3.0.0 as of this statement) is a major update, and has some breaking chang
es]. For this tutorial to work, we'll stick to the version 2.10.0. You can install that version by adding ==2.
10.0 to the package name in the command below (it has already been added for you)*

```
sudo pip3 install pyowm==2.10.0
git clone https://github.com/protostax/ProtoStax_Weather_Station_Demo.git
```

## Usage

```
cd ProtoStax_Weather_Station_Demo
```

Edit main.py and add your Open Weather Map API key and City ID for the
city whose weather report you like

**NOTE - Using Python 3 or higher!**

```
python3.7 main.py
```
